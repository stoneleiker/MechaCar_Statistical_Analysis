## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### * Which Variables/Coeffcients prodivded a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values i nthe dataset?
### all PR>T have in coefficient to find amount of variance and the results of vehicles length and ground clearance with provide not more likley random amount of variance. Vehcile, spolilter angle, and AWD are provide random amount from variances.
### The slope of the linear are not zero because all have a demcial so not zero.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The three lots summary show variance less than 10 except LOT 3 has 170 variance. The average is 62 variance for the lots. The three lots have a common amount of mean and median. The three lots have a SD less than 3 except LOT 3 has 13 SD. The average is 7.89 SD. 
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
# T-Test on Total
# I have a Lot 1 to 3 from folder for tests on Suspension Coils.
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
# I would to be test the mpg of MechaCar compare with the average of group if I better than or not for average.
